                    <h2>How to Perfect Your Pie Crust Every Time</h2>
                    <p class="post-meta">Published on September 28, 2024</p>
                    <p>A flaky, buttery pie crust is the foundation of a great pie. Here's how to achieve that perfect texture every time:</p>
                    <p>* Choose the Right Ingredients: Use cold butter and ice water to create a flaky crust. High-quality flour is also key.</p>
                    <p>* Knead with Care: Avoid overworking the dough. Mix until just combined, then let it rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>* Blind Baking: For custard or cream pies, blind bake your crust to prevent sogginess. Use pie weights or dried beans to keep it flat while baking.</p>

                    <p>Keep your baked goods fresh and delicious with these storage tips:</p>
                    <p>* Cookies: Store in an airtight container to keep them crispy. For soft cookies, add a slice of bread to maintain moisture.</p>
                    <p>* Cakes: Cover cakes with plastic wrap or a cake dome. For layered cakes, keep the layers separate until serving.</p>
                    <p>* Freezing: Many baked goods freeze well! Wrap individually in plastic wrap, then place in a freezer bag. Thaw at room temperature.</p>
